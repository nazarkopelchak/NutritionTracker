# NutritionTracker

## Overview

The NutritionTracker app allows users to search for various food items and their nutritional values, such as calories, protein, sugar, fat, thanks to the EDAMAM database. If the product is not in the database,
the user has the option to use a _custom mode_, that allows the user manually enter nutritional values of the food products. All nutritional data is stored locally,
and can be reset daily at the specific time at the user's discretion (this feature must be enabled in the Settings screen to work). Reset data will be stored on the History screen where
users can access it at any time.
