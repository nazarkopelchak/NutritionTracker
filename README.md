# NutritionTracker

## Overview

The NutritionTracker app allows users to search various food items and their nutritional values thanks to the EDAMAM database. If the item is not in the database,
the user has the option to use a _custom mode_, that allows the user manually enter nutritional values of the food products. All nutritional data is stored locally,
and can be reset daily if the user desires to (this feature must be turned on to work in the Settings screen). Resetted data will be stored on the History screen where
users can access it at any time.
